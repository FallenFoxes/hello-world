# hello-world
 first assignment for 3049c

My name is Gabrielle,but everyone has called me Gabby! I am a junior in IT by credit hour and I am double majoring (tracking) in IT while getting a minor in Psychology. 
I recently moved to campus and have adopted a calico named Chloe. I love to play video games in my spare time and go hang out with friends. I have 2 jobs currently,
one being a CO-OP and the other being a job that assists with tuition reimbursement! I have spent time in the past coding as well as even attempting to stream games via
Twitch.TV!
